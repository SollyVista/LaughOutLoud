## Instructions

These were the instructions I was given to guide me in this task:

**Follow these steps:**

- Create a new project using Next.js. This should be a dynamic website that is created using data retrieved from an API. You can use a simple API of your choice. Here are a few suggestions:
  - Musixmatch API
  - The Star Wars API
  - Spotify API

The web app should contain at least two pages: an index page and a page that displays details about the topic that the user selects on the index page. For example, if you create your app using the Star Wars API you could
display all the films (e.g. https://swapi.dev/api/films) on the index page and all the details about the specific film selected by the user on the details page (e.g. https://swapi.dev/api/films/1).

- Be sure that your website is attractively styled and that you share a layout component.
